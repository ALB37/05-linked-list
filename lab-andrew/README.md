I added the find function to the linked-list class. As defined, find takes one parameter, value, which I have restricted to being a number. It could be any data type, for instance, we could store an object or a string in the value position of a linked list, however, for this exercise it will arbitrarily be limited to numbers. It will return the node of the linked list which has a value that matches the argument supplied. If no value matches, it will return undefined and log a message notifying that no value was found in the LinkedList. If a type other than number is supplied as an argument, it will throw an error. One other function I modified is the remove. In its previous state, one could not delete the first node of a LinkedList. Now it is possible to.
